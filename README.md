# metadata.poems

Script to pull metadata from DigitalNZ description fields and turn them into short poems.

## Usage

1) Update `credentials.py` with your DigitalNZ API key (http://digitalnz.org/api_keys).
2) Run `poet.py` to print out the words to the console.

This isn't properly hooked it up to Twitter in an automated way yet. I leave that as an exercise for the reader.
